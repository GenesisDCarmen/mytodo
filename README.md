# Mytodo

#### Warning : this software is still in development don't use in production.


Mytodo is a free/libre (as in speech) todolist manager it protects totally the privacy of the user because the user himself will setup and hack this script for his own sake, basically this project focuses more on the user freedom rather than the quality of the software which comes in a second place.

This project mainly contains two parts the server part which is a really simple python code you can setup on any old machine or even a raspberry pi and a client software.

For the client part have already :

  - A console based client.
  - A really simple GUI tool.

## Setting Up:

This project is written in python (version 2) so you need to have it installed if you are running a GNU/Linux distribution like Debian or whatever I suppose that you have it installed.

It also depends on WXpython and Sqlite3.
If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution you can get it:
for example on Debian :

> sudo  apt-get install python-wxgtkx.y sqlite3

colorama is optional (if you want some colors in your console and that works under windows too you shall install it) no more escape codes.

You can Install it using pip

> sudo pip install colorama

You can clone the repository using

>git clone https://github.com/mohamed-aziz/mytodo.git

Or you can download the zip.

Once your clone is done  and the dependencies are satisfied you can simply run the server on your local computer if you don't have another machine and simply run the client that you want it could be the cli one if you are CLI nerd like me.


I can't tell you more it's not hacking anymore, discover the rest by yourself.

Happy hacking !

------------------

## TODO or brainstorming:
  - Write a web application.
  - Write an android application (using kivy maybe I started discovering it)
  - Improve the networking code
  - Improve the GUI
  - Add the ability to record sounds and videos
  - The ability to draw using the mouse or the touchpad


(These ideas are worthless if they are not implemented)
